# Sales Summary Report

## Project Description
The **Sales Summary Report** is a single-page web application designed to fetch and analyze sales data from a CSV file. It sums the values in the sales column and presents the total on the page. This project aims to provide a quick and efficient way to visualize sales data, enhancing decision-making processes for businesses.

## Features
- Fetches sales data from a CSV file.
- Calculates the total sales amount.
- Displays the total sales in a user-friendly format.
- Utilizes Bootstrap 5 for responsive design.
- Live demo available for real-time interaction.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the Sales Summary Report locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/24f2008913/sum-of-sales-20251017163421.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd sum-of-sales-20251017163421
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File in Your Browser**
   You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser to view the application.

## Usage Guide
1. Ensure that you have the `data.csv` file in the appropriate directory (as specified in the code).
2. Open the application in a web browser.
3. The title "Sales Summary Report" will be displayed at the top.
4. The total sales amount will be calculated and displayed in the designated `#total-sales` element.

## Code Explanation
The main components of the application are:

- **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file contains the basic structure, including the title and a designated area for displaying the total sales.
  
- **Bootstrap 5 Integration**: The application loads Bootstrap 5 from jsdelivr to ensure a responsive and modern design.

- **JavaScript Logic**: The script fetches the `data.csv` file, parses it, and sums the sales column. The total is then displayed in the `#total-sales` element.

Here is a simplified overview of the JavaScript logic:
```javascript
fetch('data.csv')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(data => {
    const rows = data.split('\n').slice(1); // Skip header row
    let totalSales = 0;
    
    rows.forEach(row => {
      const columns = row.split(',');
      totalSales += parseFloat(columns[1]); // Assuming sales are in the second column
    });
    
    document.getElementById('total-sales').innerText = totalSales;
  });
```
